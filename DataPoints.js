Such systems learn (progressively improve performance) to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming.    Designing a neural network in Java or any other programming language requires an understanding of the structure and functionality of artificial neural networks. Artificial neural networks perform tasks such as pattern recognition, learning from data, and forecasting trends just like an expert can, as opposed to the conventional algorithmic approach that requires a set of steps to be performed to achieve the defined goal. An ANN can learn how to solve some task by itselfbecause of its highly interconnected...", "id": 170}, {"title": "Scripthica: Learn how to create computer-generated music. by Gabriel Sanchez - Kickstarter", "url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/69028924/scripthica-learn-how-to-create-computer-generated\n", "reliability": 37, "title_obj": 55, "text_obj": 41, "text": "I'm building a computer-assisted music composition web environment so that anyone can create and share algorithmic computer music.
