          You are invited to take part in research taking place at the
          University of the West of England, Bristol. Before you decide whether
          to take part, it is important for you to understand why the study is
          being done and what it will involve. Please read the following
          information carefully and if you have any queries or would like more
          information please contact Gabriel Lyu, Faculty of Environment and
          Technology, University of the West of England, Bristol
          [haorui2.lyu@live.uwe.ac.uk]

          The research is looking at getting people aware of information
          credibility through games. Our research questions is whether this is
          possible and how effective this approach would be. To help us answer
          these questions we will be publishing our game online and ask you to
          try the whole game process. The aim of your participation in the game
          will be to collect information that will be made anonymous.
        </p>
        <p>
          The results of our study will be analysed and used in a Report made
          available on the University of the West of England’s open-access
          repository. The anonymised results may also be used in conference
          papers and peer-reviewed academic papers.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a student dissertation project, we are interested in gaining
          information about your capability of identifying credible online
          information before and after playing the game, as well as the game
          progress. You will be asked one question at the beginning and the end
          of the game, respectively, and also some quick questions about the
          game experience. The purpose of the questions will be to assess the
          quality of the game and the effectiveness of game as an approach of
          educating information credibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          You do not have to take part in this research. It is up to you to
          decide whether or not you want to be involved. If you do decide to
          take part, you will be given a copy of this information sheet to keep
          and will be asked to sign a consent form. If you do decide to take
          part, you are able to withdraw from the research without giving a
          reason until the point at which your data is anonymised and can
          therefore no longer be traced back to you. This point will take place
          14 days from the date you signed your consent form. If you want to
          withdraw from the study within this period, please write to Gabriel
          Lyu(haorui2.lyu@live.uwe.ac.uk). Deciding not to take part or to
          withdrawal from the study does not have any penalty, and will not
          affect your assessment marks.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you agree to take part you will be asked to take part in the game
          after the conscent form page. This will be conducted online by Gabriel
          Lyu. The team are all experienced in the subject matter and are
          sensitive to issues it may raise. The game will take up to 15 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although you will be asked to fill in your name in the conscent form,
          your name is not collected. Instead, the only identifier for a
          participant will be the timestamp, which will be replaced by numbers
          in the data analysis process. This process will happen on 12/09/2019.
          Your data will be anonymised at this point and will be analysed with
          interview data from other anonymised participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not foresee or anticipate any significant risk to you in taking
          part in this study. If, however, you feel uncomfortable at any time
          you can close the page to stop. If you need any support during or
          after the activity then the researchers will be able to put you in
          touch with suitable support agencies. The research team are
          experienced in game production and are sensitive to the subject area.
          The game has been designed with these considerations in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the information that you give will be kept confidential and
          anonymised at 23:59 11/09/2019. The only circumstance where we may not
          be able to keep your information confidential is when you're involved
          in a police investigation, when we will provide your data to comply
          with the law. Hard copy research material will be kept in a locked and
          secure setting to which only the researchers will have access in
          accordance with the University’s and the Data Protection Act 2018 and
          General Data Protection Regulation requirements. Your anonymised data
          will be analysed together with other interview and file data, and we
          will ensure that there is no possibility of identification or
          re-identification from this point.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Report will be written containing our research findings. This Report
          will be available on the University of the West of England’s
          open-access Research Repository. A hard copy of the Report will be
          made available to all research participants if you would like to see
          it. Key findings will also be shared both within and outside the
          University of the West of England. Anonymous and non-identifying
          direct quotes may be used for publication and presentation purposes.
        </p>
